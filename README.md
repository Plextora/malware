# Plextora's Malware
This repo contains malware that I've made for Windows computers. Make sure to run this in a Virtual Machine and not any computer that you use!!!!!!

This repo has the "exe" folder for running the malware, and the "bat" folder for editing the malware.

# Here's an explaination for what each file does:

## SYSTEM_NUKE.bat/exe

This file deletes the C:\Windows folder. Which basically just nukes the system past recovery

## apps go brrr.bat/exe

This file opens up random windows apps. This hurts the performance of windows alot

## cd drives go brrrr.bat/exe

this just screws up the cd drive thing on your old laptop

## delete_antiviruses.bat/exe

As far as I know, this is the only file that triggers Windows Defender. It does this because this file deletes all antiviruses on your computer.

## delete_registry_files.bat/exe

This just deletes critical registry files. AKA just ruins the system

## folders go brrr.bat/exe

This creates a massive amount of folders in random directories

## internet_death.bat/exe

Turns off the ability to connect to the internet

## notepad go brrrr.bat/exe

Opens up notepad windows until the system crashes
